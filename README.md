# :pizza: Mondello Italian Restaurant - Gatsby website

## Website Live

## Design

Website of a traditional Italian restaurant. Black, white and gold are probably not associated with food, but I wanted to deviate a bit from the standards in this design.
I wanted the layout of the website to be modern, but thanks to the typography and a few small elements, I would keep the historical style of the restaurant.

## Coding

This is my first larger project with Gatsby.js. I dive deeper into styled components, I also add some fireworks with GSAP 3 and ScrollTrigger plugin.
